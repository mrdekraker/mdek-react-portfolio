            Full Stack Web Developer.
            <br />
            <br />
            I have a background in education, management, customer service, and
            music. I really found my passion in creating beautiful, functional
            websites, however. I emphatically pursued my passion through the
            Rice University Full Stack Bootcamp course, and passed with a 4.0
            gpa. While it was a challenging course, it was a very rewarding
            experience.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a result, I am now capable of creating in a full MERN stack, and
            I am eager to put my skills to work for you. I am eagerly searching
            for a position as a Junior Full Stack Web Developer, Junior Front
            End, or Junior Back End.
            <br />
            <br />I am a hard worker, and I am always looking to improve my
            skills. I welcome any challenges and I would love to work with you.
