## Overview

This is my latest portfolio. I built it with the help of [Ed Roh](https://github.com/ed-roh), a phenomenal instructor. The main portion of the portfolio is built with React, and the contact form is built with React-hook-form and [Form Submit](https://formsubmit.co/). The portfolio is deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Future

The direction I see this going in the future is to add a blog section. I would like to be able to write about my experiences as a developer, and share my knowledge with others.

I also would like to add more projects in the future. I have a few ideas for projects that I would like to build, and I would like to add them to the portfolio to replace some of my weaker projects.

It is also a goal to become more proficient with front end technologies. I would like to add more animations and transitions to the portfolio.
